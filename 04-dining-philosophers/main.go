// The dining philosophers problem is well known in computer science circles. Five philosophers, numbered from 0
// through 4, live in a house where the table is laid for them; each philosopher has their own p√•late at the table.
// Their only difficulty, besides those of philosophy, is that the dish is served as a very difficult kind of spaghetti
// which has to be eaten with two forks. There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no difficulty. As a
// consequence however, this means that no two neighbours may be eating simultaneously, since there are five
// philosophers and five forks.

// This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's solution to the "Dining Philosophers" dilemma.

	name      string
